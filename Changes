Revision history for Perl extension ExtUtils::Manifest.

=head1 1.30, Mar 14, 1997

Folded back changes from perl5.003_93, mainly for VMS.

Included patch from Roderick Schertler, namely: allow comments in
MANIFEST

Changed behaviour as suggested by Roderick: carp if the C<how>
argument to cp_if_diff() is invalid (instead of fail silently).

=head1 1.28, Dec 6, 1996

This is the fist version broken out of the MakeMaker distribution. It
incorporates a tiny change in best(). If ln() fails, we cp(). Patch
sent in by Doug MacEachern who had some link failures on AFS. Thanks,
Doug!
